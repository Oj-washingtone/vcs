fetch = +refs/heads/_:refs/remotes/origin/_
Purpose: The fetch line is used to define what branches to fetch from the remote repository and where to store them in your local repository.

+refs/heads/\*:

This means "fetch all branches from the remote repository".
refs/heads/_ is a reference to all the branches in the remote repository (_ is a wildcard that matches all branches).
The + at the beginning means force-fetch: if a branch exists locally and has diverged from the remote branch (i.e., both have commits that the other doesn't), this will overwrite the local branch with the remote branch during the fetch operation.
refs/remotes/origin/\*:

This specifies where to store the fetched branches locally. In this case, it's storing them under refs/remotes/origin/.
refs/remotes/origin/\* means all the branches fetched from the remote repository will be stored in the local repository under the origin remote (in the refs/remotes/origin/ namespace).
So, when you run git fetch, Git will fetch all branches from the origin remote and store them in the refs/remotes/origin/ namespace locally.

In simpler terms: This line ensures that all the branches from the remote origin are fetched and stored under refs/remotes/origin/, and the + makes sure any divergence between local and remote branches is resolved by overwriting the local branch with the remote one if necessary.
