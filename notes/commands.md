fetch = +refs/heads/_:refs/remotes/origin/_
Purpose: The fetch line is used to define what branches to fetch from the remote repository and where to store them in your local repository.

+refs/heads/\*:

This means "fetch all branches from the remote repository".
refs/heads/_ is a reference to all the branches in the remote repository (_ is a wildcard that matches all branches).
The + at the beginning means force-fetch: if a branch exists locally and has diverged from the remote branch (i.e., both have commits that the other doesn't), this will overwrite the local branch with the remote branch during the fetch operation.
refs/remotes/origin/\*:

This specifies where to store the fetched branches locally. In this case, it's storing them under refs/remotes/origin/.
refs/remotes/origin/\* means all the branches fetched from the remote repository will be stored in the local repository under the origin remote (in the refs/remotes/origin/ namespace).
So, when you run git fetch, Git will fetch all branches from the origin remote and store them in the refs/remotes/origin/ namespace locally.

In simpler terms: This line ensures that all the branches from the remote origin are fetched and stored under refs/remotes/origin/, and the + makes sure any divergence between local and remote branches is resolved by overwriting the local branch with the remote one if necessary.

Tracking files based on branches in a version control system (VCS) like Git involves managing file changes (additions, modifications, deletions) specific to each branch. Each branch essentially represents a separate line of development, allowing changes to exist independently until merged. Here's a breakdown of how tracked files are managed and how they differ across branches:

1. The Basics of File Tracking in Branches
   Tracked Files: Files that the system monitors for changes. These are part of the source control repository after being added (e.g., using add).
   Untracked Files: Files that exist in the directory but are not yet added to the repository. They remain unmonitored.
   Ignored Files: Files explicitly excluded using a mechanism like .gitignore or .scignore.
   Each branch maintains its own history of tracked files and their states. When you switch branches, the working directory reflects the tracked files and their respective states for the active branch.

2. Key Aspects of Tracking Files by Branch
   File States
   New Files: Files added in the branch but not yet committed.
   Modified Files: Tracked files whose contents differ from the last commit.
   Deleted Files: Tracked files removed in the branch.
   Branch Independence
   File Versions: Each branch can have a different version of the same file. For example:
   In main: src/index.js might have version A.
   In feature-branch: src/index.js might have version B.
   File Existence: A file might exist in one branch but not in another.
   Merging
   When branches are merged:

Changes are combined: If the same file is modified in both branches, conflicts might arise, requiring resolution.
New files are added: Files created in one branch are introduced into the target branch unless ignored.
